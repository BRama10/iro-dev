The overall goal of this feature is to allow users to enter in a word/phrase/idea and it will supply them with around ~8 video ideas that they can choose from. These will be displayed in the UI below the search bar that they typed their request into(in a list that you can scroll through). The user will also be able to 'fork' or 'tree' from their idea. This ends up creating a new list that focuses on variations of the video idea that the user decided to 'fork/tree' off of.

Some additional notes
	•	Some amount of spacing between the tops/bottoms of each list item Is ideal so things do not seem too crammed.
	•	Maybe 3 list items displayed on the screen at any given time would be ideal (they will likely extend across two lines each and can ellipses (…) at the end of the second).
	•	The first horizontal line should maybe be a bit thicker or there should be some indicator that separates that top search bar from the list items below.
	•	For the fork/tree aspect, we can shoot for allowing the user to go one layer deep for now
	•	The video ideas should also have some amount of variety between them while still relating to the user’s prompt.
	•	The fork/tree tab that pops up should basically resemble the initial list, except every list item is a variant/fork from the chosen list Item that the user chose to fork off of.
